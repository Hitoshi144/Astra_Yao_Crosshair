This is a scope that will make you unrivaled! Personally, I have already become a radiant in Valorant with it. („¬ᴗ¬„)

Even though the project is a joke, I did everything to make this scope **easy to use**:

* You can _hide_ or _show_ the sight by pressing the " **`** " button on the English layout, or " **ё** " on the Russian layout;

* You can _flip_ the sight images horizontally by pressing the "**l alt**" button;

* The functions described above are also _available from the tray menu_, which is opened by right-clicking on the application icon in the tray;

* Also, _in the tray menu_, there is an option to **change the image opacity value** (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%);

* Finally, you can **close the application** by clicking "_Exit_" in the application menu from the tray.

Interesting fact - you can put any of **your own images**. The main thing is that it is in _png format_ and _pre-fitted to the size of your screen_. 
To use your own image, name it "**astra_yao.png**" and replace it in the directory where the executable file "**Astra Yao Crosshair.exe**" is located.
